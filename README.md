# 🦁🐯 Multi-Class Animal Recognition 🐶🦓

## 🚀 Deep Learning Project for Animal Image Classification

---

## 📌 Overview

Welcome to the **Multi-Class Animal Recognition** project — a deep learning-based classification system designed to recognize and categorize multiple types of animals from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project is a practical application of modern computer vision techniques tailored to wildlife conservation, smart zoos, automated animal monitoring, and educational tools.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a robust CNN model for multi-animal image classification.
- Preprocess and augment image data for enhanced model generalization.
- Evaluate performance through metrics and training visualizations.
- Leverage popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.
